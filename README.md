## About:

This is a mini project for NTU SC1015 (Introduction to Data Science and Artificial Intelligence) where we analyse datasets from kaggle.com and fbref.com

Football has evolved from being merely a sport in the 21st century. The latest 2022 Qatar World Cup garnered a viewership of over 1 billion, underscoring the lucrative and entertaining nature of the global football scene. Given the intense competition for a share of the spoils, investors are now seeking more than just favorable match outcomes. 

Therefore, football managers are shifting their focus towards identifying talented players and nurturing them before selling them at a premium price to generate a substantial return on investment, following the adage of "buy low, sell high."

## Problem Statement:

To increase the likelihood of discovering such players, a football scout must be cognizant of the traits and statistics that are integral to a player's potential for an increase in monetary value in the future.

## Solution

By determining the top 5 factors that correlate with an increase in monetary value of the player, by position

## What Did We Learn From This Project?
This project provided us with valuable insights into the practical application of Data Science in solving real-world issues, such as the economics of football. As sports enthusiasts, we relished the opportunity to work on a project that piqued our interest. One of the most impactful outcomes of this project was the ability to predict whether there will be a rise in a player's value, which has significant implications for the industry. Moreover, we gained a new perspective by applying GridSearchCV and learning beyond the classroom setting.

Overall, this was an engaging and fulfilling project that allowed us to apply the knowledge gained in the classroom to a real-world context, and we thoroughly enjoyed working on it.
