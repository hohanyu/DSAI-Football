Football has evolved from being merely a sport in the 21st century. The latest 2022 Qatar World Cup garnered a viewership of over 1 billion, underscoring the lucrative and entertaining nature of the global football scene. Given the intense competition for a share of the spoils, investors are now seeking more than just favorable match outcomes. 

Therefore, football managers are shifting their focus towards identifying talented young players and nurturing them to maturity before selling them at a premium price to generate a substantial return on investment, following the adage of "buy low, sell high."

## Problem Statement:

To increase the likelihood of discovering such players, a football scout must be cognizant of the traits and factors that are integral to a player's potential for commanding a high monetary value in the future.

## Solution

Identifying the future monetary worth of football players by analysing pertinent factors (determine the three most critical factors for each of the three key positions).
